## Introduction
---
[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)
- This is a security camera software which detects any intruder and alerts the owner .
- This is the basic prototype , we'll make it un-hack-able by using microphone and eliminating every possible hack to fool our software.
- Many issues are up-for-grabs. Check them out from issues tab.


### Technologies:
- `Python 3.6`
- `Opencv (cv2)` [tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/loading-images-python-opencv-tutorial/)

### How it works?
We take a snapshot of the room , lets call this `base.jpg`. Now , the code continuously scan the current frame and subtract it from `base.jpg`.
If the difference is more than a threshold , we'll consider a breach happening.



## Setup instructions
---
[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)
- To run , simply copy the code in the `UltimateSecurityCam.py` and run it.
- More formally , fork the code , and clone it your machine . I recommend that you use the GitH desktop app.
  - If you need a python IDE , I recommend using pycharm. [Tutorial to install : ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzcaEELafkE).
  - If you get an error , make sure all the **import statements are working** , if not , install using pip-install [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237dNNQhD3Q)


## Running instructions : 
- Open up StarterCode.py in your preferred python IDE [windows.py](PythonCode/Windows.py)

### Running instructions: 
- Open up `UltimateSecurityCam.py` in your preferred python IDE [UltimateSecurityCam.py](PythonCode/UltimateSecurityCam.py)

- Run using python 3.6 (recommended).
- The program takes 3-second waiting time, after that it starts detecting motion , making an alert sound.

Many improvements and developments are in the pipeline! To know more, contact on github or niteshx22@gmail.com
The project was created during Njack winter of code ' 18.
